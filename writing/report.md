# CMPSC 302 Final Report

## Was your project a success? Describe why or why not.

Overall, my project was a success. I managed to create a Tic Tac Toe game that functions. I implemented the HTML correctly so that I was able to have a base to add and remove things to, and allow for things to be displayed. I managed to get the CSS to a point where the game looks decent and everything is displayed on the screen neatly. The javascript also performs every action that I had in mind for the game. The basics of playing the game along with a few extra things like drawing a line through the win were implemented well. The game works well and looks okay for what I was capable of doing in this window of time. Even though it is a success, I do not believe it was a true success. I still see many areas for improvement. If I had the time and knowledge I would definitely add more and more to make the game better as a whole. But not only this, My project is technically a failure because I had to throw away my initial proposed idea because there was no way I would have been able to implement that before it was due. Regardless, I am happy with the final product and I view it as a relative success.

## What surprising skills did you learn as part of developing the project?

Some skills I learned as a part of developing this project were different CSS properties that I could utilize to manipulate elements. I managed to experiment with rotations and origin transformations and many other new kinds of properties. These allowed me to do things with elements that I never was able to do before. As well as this, I also learned new skills within the field of javascript. I managed to become more confident in coding with pure javascript. I have come to understand the syntax of the language better and what I can and cannot do with it. Also, I had to experiment with grabbing coordinates of elements and manipulating these for later use. This was a very eye opening and useful skill for me to learn because it allows for many different kinds of things to be done that I would not know how to do otherwise.

## Reflect on the areas where you believe you've demonstrated the most strength/knowledge.

I showed the most strength in the HTML area. I had no issues regarding the HTML throughout the development of this project and all situations where it needed editing were easy to work around and gave me no trouble. CSS was the area that I feel I showed the second best strength and knowledge. The basic CSS was not difficult to implement. It took a bit of trial and error, but overall it did not leave me stumped. These two areas definitely showed the most strength, compared to the javascript where I spend much of the time learning new things.

## How does completing this project further your professional or academic goals?

It furthers my professional and academic goals because it taught me a lot about languages that will be useful for me to know in the future. Because I am planning on majoring in computer science, knowing HTML, CSS, and javascript are very valuable in my eyes. I feel I can use these for many things, and even if it turns out I can not, having the knowledge and experience working with this kind of development is still useful regardless.

## From the syllabus, choose at least `2` learning objectives you achieved, and describe how below.

`Express basic fluency in HTML5, CSS, Javascript, and nodeJS markup/programming languages:` For this objective, I achieved it because this is entirely what my project is based around. My focus on this project was to solidify these skills and to gain a deeper understanding of them. Seeing as my project was a relative success, I would say that this objective was completed.

`Understand and deploy strategies which build accessible and responsive web content:` For this objective, I achieved it because I used a color pallete in a way that I think is colorblind accessible. Also, the page is very responsive because of a status bar that updates, displaying the relevant info about the game. Also, it makes it clear who won, and how they won by adding a distinguishable line though the winning pattern. All of this comes together to create an accessible and responsive game.
