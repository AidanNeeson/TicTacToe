# CMPSC 302 Project Description

## Description

The idea that I have in mind for a final project is a new game. I plan on combining many of the simpler concepts we have learned, expanding on them, and furnishing them into one game. The idea for the game that I have right now is one made from HTML, CSS, and Javascript (obviously) that runs locally on your computer, no server or contract features as of right now, where the premise is that there is a ball and a basket, and the ball needs to end up in the basket. The player will do this by drawing on the screen a pathway or course for the ball to roll across. I will create multiple levels with various different layouts, hoping to tie them all together with javascript so the player does not have to manually go to a level's file location in the webpage.

## Areas of development

As a start, I feel that the HTML piece of this project I know very well. It is, for sure, the least confusing part of the project. I believe I have all of the skills and knowledge to tackle the HTML with minimal confusion. The CSS is also a piece that I feel I know well. For basic styling of the game, the CSS will be no issue, but I do plan on expanding upon this. I hope to develop more CSS skills and learn new ways of styling to really bring the game to life visually. The Javascript, however; is something that I will need to develop better skills and knowledge in. Although we have been working with it for a while now, I still do not really know the language well enough to just do whatever I want. I will need to do exstensive experimentation and searching around on public forums to help me learn about all the necessary Javascript features I will need to be implementing.

## Challenges

One challenge I know I will encounter is with the CSS. I am very picky about the way that things look, and now that I have more freedom to experiment with it in greater detail, I will find it very difficult to actually find the right style for the game. Not only that, but there also things that I will want to do that depend on the CSS that I do not know how to do and will have difficulty implementing them. Another challenge will be scripting the physics of the ball. I feel it will be difficult for me to figure out how to script gravity, speed, and collisions using Javascript. Another challenge I feel will be getting the track drawing working. I feel like making a line appear by clicking and dragging would be hard to do for someone like me who has little knowledge with the language.

## Ideal outcome

I feel like a fully implemented project will look exactly as it is imaged in any one's head. I want a good looking game that lets you draw lines to allow a ball to roll into a basket. I want the physics and collisions to feel right. I want the line drawing to be smooth and responsive. I also want the game to look appealing to a certian degree. I feel that if all of this is implemented as it is in my head, it will be incredibly beneficial because it will further my skills in Javascript, which is something that I want to do and need to do. Im hoping it will give me confidence to be able to use Javascript like I can use Python. As well as this, I hope it refines my CSS and HTML skills even more.
