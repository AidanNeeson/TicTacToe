## How To Play

- First, just navigate to the GitHub Pages site that was deployed for this repository, then open up the site.
- Once you are there, the game has already begun!
- Typical Tic-Tac-Toe rules apply:
    - X starts first.
    - Players take turns placing X's and O's until one player manages to get three of their respective letter in a row.
    - If no one manages to get three in a row, the game comes to a draw.
- Once the game is officially over, the winner gets displayed, if there is one.
- The game can be restarted at any point throughout playing

Now you are a Tic-Tac-Toe-Pro, get to challenging your friends!
